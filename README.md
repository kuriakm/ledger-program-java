# ledger-program-java
This is a console-run basic ledger program that I programmed for my own use.

This is a personal project of mine that I decided to share on GitHub. It is a Java-based program that should run on any operating system but I programmed this with Windows and Debian-Linux in mind (debugging still needed to make sure it runs on the latter).
