# ledger-program-java
This is a console-run basic ledger program that I programmed for my own use.

This is a personal project of mine that I decided to share on GitHub. It is a Java-based program that should run on any operating system but I programmed this with Windows and Debian-Linux in mind.

Note: I used OpenJDK 20 for the Windows version and OpenJDK 19 for the Linux version.
